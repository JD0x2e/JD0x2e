Hi, I'm Jack and I'm a massive Crypto/Defi enthusiast. I am very interested in Web3 and can't wait to see where the future takes me. I have attended a Full Stack MERN Bootcamp taught by the great [Wollivan](https://github.com/Wollivan) at [Tech Educators](https://techeducators.co.uk/), which has brought me the skills I needed to further my career. I love everything about coding, the writing, the testing, the bug fixing, what is there not to love about it? I'm completely mad about Tech in general and cannot wait to see where this career can take me.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª JD's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey actually way back in December 2021. I struggled at first to get to grips with the syntax and how it should be written so I eventually stopped as I was working full-time at the current time and just couldn't dedicate any more brain space to learn. It wasn't until July of 2022 when I was reached out to by a fellow crypto enthusiast/friend, about a course that his company was running, this turned out to be the best decision of my life. I started at the beginning of August and by November I had finished this intensive bootcamp and felt a breathe of fresh air. I could make websites and apps, I could actually code by myself and it felt so great. Fast forward to now, I know many different languages and I am now venturing into the world of Web3 development, taking a particular interest in Solidity and Smart Contracts. The time is now, I will become the best Solidity developer you have ever seen. Watch this space.
